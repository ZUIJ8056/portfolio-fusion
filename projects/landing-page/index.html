                <h2>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</h2>
                <p>My current favorite PS5 game is <strong>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</strong>, an intense asymmetrical horror experience based on the classic 1974 horror film. This multiplayer game pits a team of victims trying to escape against the terrifying Sawyer family, including the iconic Leatherface.</p>

                    <h3>Why I Love This Game:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Authentic 1970s horror atmosphere that perfectly captures the movie's vibe</li>
                        <li>Heart-pounding cat-and-mouse gameplay</li>
                        <li>Unique asymmetrical multiplayer (3 vs 4 matches)</li>
                        <li>Each family member has distinct abilities and playstyles</li>
                        <li>Genuinely terrifying sound design and visuals</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>The game requires teamwork, strategy, and quick thinking whether you're playing as the victims trying to escape or as the killers hunting them down. No two matches ever play out the same way!</p>
